#### **The 1st Rule of Spreadsheets:** know when *NOT* to use spreadsheets...
#### **The 2nd Rule of Spreadsheets:** have better options than spreadsheets...
#### **The 3rd Rule of Spreadsheets:** disregard Rule 2 and *ALWAYS* use spreadsheets!!!

<br>

Do you follow **The 3rd Rule of Spreadsheets?** If you do, don't worry, it's not your fault. I totally understand. I use spreadsheets almost every day. They can definitely be the right tools for the job, until they're not. When they're not, you usually know it and follow **The 1st Rule of Spreadsheets**. No problems there. Unfortunately it's the **The 2nd Rule of Spreadsheets** at the core of the problem as it's highly unlikely that any better options are available to you. These options usually aren't available because they're often believed to be too complicated for most people who work with data. I disagree. These options are not as complicated as they're often perceived. I'll elaborate more here when I finish the rest of my site, but for now please head back to [JeffreyLevine.com](http://www.jeffreylevine.com) to check out some of these options for yourself. I've been trying to retire [SpreadsheetsGoneWild.com](http://www.spreadsheetsgonewild.com) for a while now anyway, it's a long story...  *Thanks, Jeff*
